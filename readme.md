# One More Office

## Brief

A game of logic where the player has to find the missing piece for each level of an
office building.

## Usage

The game is written in vanilla JavaScript. It can be run locally by, e.g., using the
Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code on the game's `index.html` or executing
`python3 -m http.server` within the game's root directory.
