1a/1b:
  The desks/plants in the right column are those that are in both the
  middle and the left column.The plants/presents create a symmetric
  pattern for each row.

2a/2b:
  The human/server in the right column / top row is always at the crossing
  point of where the the desks in the left and middle column / bottom and
  middle row are heading to.

3a/3B
  The sum of humans/presents and candles on cakes is the same for each cell.

4:
  The pattern of the violet servers in the upper left cell rotates 90Â°
  clockwise for each successive cell (left-right, top-down).
  The same applies for the pattern of the orange servers in the upper
  left cell. The onyx-colored servers also rotate but each independently.
  One clockwise, the other counter clockwise. The onyx-colored servers
  furthermore overlay other servers if they are on the same tile.

5:
  Each human is looking at another human and vice-versa.

6:
  The object pattern in the bottom row is the difference between the
  object patterns in the middle and the top row.

7a/b:
  From the top row towards the bottom row, one server/desk always cycles
  in one direction (horizontally or vertically) through the cell while the other two
  servers/desks cycle on the same axis in the opposite direction. The pattern of humans
  is always the same but overlayed by servers/desks.

8a/8b:
  The pattern of a's in the third column / row shows the similarities of the patterns
  of a's in two other columns / rows.
  The pattern of b's in the third column / row shows the differences of the patterns
  of b's in the other two columns / rows. The pattern of c's is the same for each cell.

9a/9b:
  The pattern of a's, b's, and c's always moves (cyclic) one tile in the direction of
  the one remaining object in order to create the pattern in the successive cell.
